Front end shopping cart application utilizing TypeScript, Bootstrap, and React!
This application is testing my knowledge of React hooks, implementing TypeScript on the front end, and creating seamless bootstrap designs.

/ is currently my signup page until i implement the backend, it routes you to the store page after clicking signup

/store is the store page where you can add things to your cart, see your quantities, total price of one product, and the total price of your cart.
